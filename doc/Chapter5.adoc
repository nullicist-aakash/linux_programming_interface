= Chapter 5: File I/O: Further Details

:toc:

== 5.1 Atomicity and Race Conditions

* All system calls are executed atomically
* We look at two situations involving file I/O where race conditions occur (more than these exist):
** Exclusive creation of file: Check if exists, and then create.
** Appending data to file via `lseek` and `write`.

== 5.2 File Control Operations: `fcntl()`
The `fcntl()` system call performs a range of control operations on an open file
descriptor.

****
[source,c]
----
#include <fcntl.h>

int fcntl(int fd, int cmd, ...);
----
****

== 5.3 Open File Status Flags
* One use of `fcntl()` is to retrieve or modify the access mode and open file status flags
of an open file.
** These are the values set by the flags argument specified in the call
to `open()`.
****
[source,c]
----
int flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL);

// We could test if the file was opened for synchronized writes as follows:
if (flags & O_SYNC)
    printf("writes are synchronized\n");
----
****

* Checking the access mode of the file is slightly more complex, since the `O_RDONLY (0)`,
`O_WRONLY (1)`, and `O_RDWR (2)` constants donâ€™t correspond to single bits in the open file
status flags. Therefore, to make this check, we mask the flags value with the constant `O_ACCMODE`, and then test for equality with one of the constants:

****
[source,c]
----
accessMode = flags & O_ACCMODE;

if (accessMode == O_WRONLY || accessMode == O_RDWR)
    printf("file is writable\n");
----
****

* We can use the `fcntl() F_SETFL` command to modify some of the open file status flags.
** The flags that can be modified are `O_APPEND`, `O_NONBLOCK`, `O_NOATIME`, `O_ASYNC`, and
`O_DIRECT`.
** Attempts to modify other flags are ignored.

== 5.4 Relationship Between File Descriptors and Open Files
* Three data structures are maintained by the kernel:
** The per-process file descriptor table.
** The system-wide table of open file descriptions.
** The file system i-node table.

* For each process, the kernel maintains a table of open file descriptors. Each entry in
this table records information about a single file descriptor, including:
** A set of flags controlling the operation of the file descriptor (there is just one
such flag, the close-on-exec flag).
** A reference to the open file description.
* System-wide table contain the following information:
** The current file offset.
** Status flags specified when opening the file (i.e., the flags argument to `open()`).
** The file access mode (read-only, write-only, or read-write, as specified in `open()`).
** Settings relating to signal-driven I/O.
** A reference to the i-node object for this file.

== 5.5 Duplicating File Descriptors
* The `dup()` call takes `oldfd`, an open file descriptor, and returns a new descriptor that
refers to the same open file description. The new descriptor is guaranteed to be the
lowest unused file descriptor.
****
[source,c]
----
#include <unistd.h>

int dup(int oldfd);
----
****
* The `dup2()` system call makes a duplicate of the file descriptor given in `oldfd` using
the descriptor number supplied in `newfd`.
** If the file descriptor specified in `newfd` is already open, `dup2()` closes it first.
** A successful `dup2()` call returns the number of the duplicate descriptor (`newfd`).
****
[source,c]
----
#include <unistd.h>

int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);
----
****

* We can also use the following command, which makes a duplicate of `oldfd` by using the lowest unused file descriptor
greater than or equal to `startfd`:
****
[source,c]
----
newfd = fcntl(oldfd, F_DUPFD, startfd);
----
****

== 5.6 File I/O at a Specified Offset: `pread()` and `pwrite()`
* The `pread()` and `pwrite()` system calls operate just like `read()` and `write()`, except that
the file I/O is performed at the location specified by offset, rather than at the current file offset.
** The file offset is left unchanged by these calls.

****
[source,c]
----
#include <unistd.h>

ssize_t pread(int fd, void *buf, size_t count, off_t offset);
ssize_t pwrite(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count, off_t offset);
----
****

* Calling pread() is equivalent to atomically performing the following calls:

****
[source,c]
----
off_t orig;

orig = lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_CUR); /* Save current offset */
lseek(fd, offset, SEEK_SET);
s = read(fd, buf, len);
lseek(fd, orig, SEEK_SET); /* Restore original file offset */
----
****

== 5.7 Scatter-Gather I/O: `readv()` and `writev()`

****
[source,c]
----
#include <sys/uio.h>

struct iovec {
    void *iov_base; /* Start address of buffer */
    size_t iov_len; /* Number of bytes to transfer to/from buffer */
};

ssize_t readv(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt);

ssize_t writev(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt);
----
****

== 5.8 Truncating a File: `truncate()` and `ftruncate()`

****
[source,c]
----
#include <unistd.h>

int truncate(const char *pathname, off_t length);

int ftruncate(int fd, off_t length);
----
****

* If the file is longer than length, the excess data is lost.
* If the file is currently shorter than length, it is extended by padding with a sequence of null bytes or a hole.

NOTE: The `truncate()` system call is unique in being the only system call that can
change the contents of a file without first obtaining a descriptor for the file via
`open()`.

== 5.9 Nonblocking I/O

== 5.10 I/O on Large Files

== 5.11 The `/dev/fd` Directory
* For each process, the kernel provides the special virtual directory `/dev/fd`.
* The following statements are equivalent:
****
[source,c]
----
fd = open("/dev/fd/1", O_WRONLY);
fd = dup(1);
----
****
* This is a good example to refer to stdin:
****
[source,bash]
----
ls | diff /dev/fd/0 oldfilelist
----
****

== 5.12 Creating Temporary Files
****
[source,c]
----
#include <stdlib.h>

int mkstemp(char *template);
----
****
* The `mkstemp()` function generates a unique filename based on a template supplied by the caller and opens the file, returning a file descriptor that can be used
with I/O system calls.
* The `template` argument takes the form of a pathname in which the last 6 characters must be `XXXXXX`.
* These 6 characters are replaced with a string that makes the filename
unique, and this modified string is returned via the `template` argument.
* The `mkstemp()` function creates the file with read and write permissions for the
file owner (and no permissions for other users), and opens it with the `O_EXCL` flag,
guaranteeing that the caller has exclusive access to the file.
* Typically, a temporary file is unlinked (deleted) soon after it is opened, using
the `unlink()` system call:

****
[source,c]
----
int fd;
char template[] = "/tmp/somestringXXXXXX";

fd = mkstemp(template);
if (fd == -1)
    errExit("mkstemp");

printf("Generated filename was: %s\n", template);
unlink(template); /* Name disappears immediately, but the file is removed only after close() */

/* Use file I/O system calls - read(), write(), and so on */

if (close(fd) == -1)
    errExit("close");
----
****

* The `tmpfile()` function creates a uniquely named temporary file that is opened for
reading and writing.

****
[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>

FILE *tmpfile(void);
----
****
